# Pendo Demo app (React Native & React Native Navigation)
This project is aimed at providing information on how to integrate Pendo SDK with React Native applications,   
in particular those developed with React Native Navigation.

Here's a sample To-Do app to show how the Pendo SDK can be integrated into any app.

## To-Do app: Project Description
In the sample app you'll be able to:
- Login into the app (No real authentication mechanism is present as it is not necessary for the purpose of this project - any username and password will "log" you into the app).
- Add new tasks.
- Remove existing tasks.
